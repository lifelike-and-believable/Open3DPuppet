rationale: Fab rejects packages with build output, executables, misplaced third-party code, or paths over 170 characters (4.3.7.3, 4.3.6.1.e).

Keep third-party code in a `ThirdParty` folder under `Source/` (`Source/ThirdParty/` or `Source/<Module>/ThirdParty/`) and record its licence. Do not add `.exe` or `.msi` files. Keep every path within the plugin folder at 170 characters or fewer, and use only English letters, digits, and underscores in folder and file names. If you add a folder other than `Source`, `Content`, `Resources`, or `Config` (such as `Docs`), list it in `Config/FilterPlugin.ini`.
